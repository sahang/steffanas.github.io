<h1>Hi there</h1>
<p> I’m Steffan, in the next couple lines you’ll probably know more about me than I care to remember. </p>

<p>Hopefully as you can tell I like making people laugh and I myself, love having a good time, which in turn is the 
basis that drives me to develop small games in my past time. For the few brief moments, in which I can get my brain 
to focus on something other than food, I tend to find myself conceptualizing witty little games that are easy to create
 and fun enough for my friends to play and still remain my friends. </p>

<p>But during the rest of my time you can usually find me outside playing basketball or some 
other sport or I’d probably be in the gym. Although ever since the release of “Pokémon Go” I’ve
 been more inclined to walk around my town catching imaginary creatures, on my smartphone than 
 any other form of activity, as sad as that sounds.</p>
 
 <h2>But who am I really?</h2>
 
<p>I am a growing programmer who loves interacting with languages such as JAVA and HTML
 to create what my mind cooks up. After the completion of my degree from the University
 of Northampton I plan to become a programme or coder professionally.</p>
 
<p>You can find out more about me through my social media such as Twitter, GitHub and the rest of the links below.</p>


<p>And also I hope you have or are having a fantastic day.</p>
